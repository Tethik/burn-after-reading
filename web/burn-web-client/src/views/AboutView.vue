  <p>This service is intended to be used as a way of sharing one-time
  messages secretly. For example passwords and other sensitive data. I needed such
  a service when resetting my Mom's email password. The optimal way would have
  been to send the password using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>,
  but good luck getting a non-IT person using that. PGP is just too complicated
  for the average user.</p>

  <p><b>Please note that this is mostly a proof of concept!</b></p>

  <h4>Basic Idea</h4>

  <p>Clientside cryptography where the encryption key is sent in the url hash.
  Expiry times to make the message somewhat ephemereal. Stored in memory to prevent
  offline tampering.</p>

  <p>
  It works by encrypting the message in javascript using symmetric encryption. 
  For this I use <a target="_blank" href="https://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/">SJCL</a>.
  The message is then stored in memory on the server which creates a uuid as a reference. 
  The client side script creates a special url for you where the key is stored in the anchor part, 
  which is by default not <a target="_blank" href="https://joakim.uddholm.com/url-secrets">sent to the server by the browser</a>. So the server never sees the encryption key.
  </p>

  <label for="example">Example url:</label>
  <input type="text" name="example" value="http://domain.tld/[uuid]#encryptionkey" class="u-full-width" readonly/>

  <p>
  Upon receieving the request, the server returns the data referenced by the uuid.
  The javascript takes the data and decrypts it using the encryptionkey taken from
  the anchor.
  </p>

  <h4>Why should I trust this?</h4>

  <p>You shouldn't. I'd rather you hosted your own instance for your company,
  family, or friends. I think the only way of providing any real security with
  clientside crypto is to have it open to review. Anything else is snakeoil. </p>
